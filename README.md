# **Player Injury Prediction and Performance Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Sports Analytics** to provide **in-depth analysis of NBA players' performance, injury prediction, and game strategy**. The model utilizes **machine learning techniques** to analyze player statistics and predict potential injuries while also offering insights into playing styles and overall contributions to team success.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  
  - **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras  
  - **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas  
  - **Visualization:** Matplotlib  

## **Project Structure**  
The project is divided into **three key parts**:  

### **1. Injury Prediction Model**  
- Predicts whether a player is at risk of injury based on past performance and health metrics.  
- Uses **classification algorithms** to analyze injury likelihood.  

### **2. Injury Type Classification**  
- Identifies the type of injury a player might sustain.  
- Applies **deep learning (ANN)** and statistical models for classification.  

### **3. Player Performance and Game Strategy Analysis**  
- Evaluates **player performance based on various metrics** (e.g., shooting attempts, speed, game involvement).  
- Utilizes **Regression & Clustering techniques** to categorize players based on playing styles.  
- Determines **player contributions** to team success through statistical analysis.  

## **Dataset**  
The project uses **NBA Player Stats and Injury Data** collected from **2013 to 2023**. This dataset includes:  
- Player attributes (age, height, weight, etc.)  
- Game performance metrics (minutes played, field goals, shooting efficiency)  
- Injury history and type  

## **Installation & Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kumar-Amitesh/Athlete_Injury_Risk_Analysis.git
   cd Athlete_Injury_Risk_Analysis
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the scripts:  
   ```bash
   python injury_prediction.py
   python injury_classification.py
   python player_performance_analysis.py
   ```  

## **Results & Insights**  
- The **injury prediction model** provides a risk assessment for NBA players.  
- The **injury classification model** categorizes potential injuries based on player history.  
- The **performance analysis model** helps in team strategy by identifying key players and their playing styles.
